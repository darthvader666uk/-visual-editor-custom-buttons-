This is found in the Yoast SEO section below the article. Use the Game name as that will Match the title of the review</span></li> 	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Just below that, you will see the Snippet preview. Press Edit Snippet and 9 times out of 10 the first sentence is enough as most mention the game and dev. if not, you may need to tweak the article but usually, I found the section might be the second sentence and use that. Basically, it needs to continue the focus word which is the game name. That should give SEO, at least, an OK. Be ideal if </span>its<span style="color: #ff0000;"> good.</span></li> 	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Readability. This is a tough one but has found with articles with a lot of text, you will need shorter sentences. I found more images is the key as not only does it split it up, but reads better. Around 5 is ideal as this is a nice split. Sometimes, Might not work but doublecheck the tab in Yoast SEO that says readability. If you make the sentences shorter and added images and not changed, then </span>dont<span style="color: #ff0000;"> spend too long on it, if you know what I mean.</span></li> 	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">When selecting the images (make sure </span>its<span style="color: #ff0000;"> a good amount to split up the text) add some captions and alt titles to help with SEO</span></li> 	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">If they have changed from this template, make sure Headings are Heading 2</span></li> 	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Images need to be Centre and large. This seems to be the ideal size and just makes it a little tidy.</span></li> 	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-preserver-spaces="true">When deciding on a featured image, the image should be clear what the game is, if you struggle to find one, ask and Im sure there will be a press kit available somewhere.</span></li> 	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Make sure there are no newlines before or after the Headings. It spaces it out nicely without adding it.</span></li> 	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">All bits of the ending article such as TC footer, articles by etc. Just make sure that all added and no gaps between them too. These can be found in the toolbar up above.</span></li> 	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">End of the article, or at the conclusion should contain an "I award {Game} a Thumb Culture {Score} Award!"</span></li> 	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">On the right-hand side, theres a post rating. make sure you put in silver, gold etc. so it shows in the articles.</span></li> 	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Make sure the Title has the platform of the game and a little tag like So e.g. "Untitled Goose Game – I’ve Been Goosed!" should be "Untitled Goose Game Switch Review – I’ve Been Goosed!"</span></li> 	<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Use Grammarly</span></li></ol> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">{Insert award Image from the button up above e.g Bronze, Silvewr, Gold, Platinum}</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">{Insert Game Trailer}</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>Disclaimer: A code was received in order to write this review.</em></p><p style="text-align: center;">For more articles from Stuart, click <a href="https://www.thumbculture.co.uk/author/stunightingale">here</a></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-7652 size-medium" src="https://www.thumbculture.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Thumb-Culture-Logo-300x191.png" alt="Thumb Culture" width="300" height="191" /></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/thumbculturev2">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/ThumbCulture/">FaceBook</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/thumb_culture?lang=en">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thumb_culture/">Instagram</a>| <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thumb_culture">Twitch</a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/21v6IpJRrAZDsZYn8yXxMW">Spotify</a> | <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/thumb-culture/id1490184285">iTunes</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/I6a5j2aakg3l52afdioyivoo2wi">Google Play Music</a> | <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/thumb-culture/e/66874772?autoplay=true">Stitcher</a></p>');
